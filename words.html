    <h2>Words</h2>
    <em>January 2014</em>

    <p>I shout into the dark, and you hear maybe a breath— <br />
    Or a nonsense chatter, the kind made by a crowd <br />
    Muddled and muffled by walls and familiarity. <br />
    It is not the words that I care for; <br />
    When they die on the journey (cold and hungry), I do not mourn. <br />
    But the volume, the creation, the hot foaming madness <br />
    Is meant for you, and that, too, is lost <br />
    At some midpoint in the wilderness between us.  </p>

    <p>To reach you, then, should I shout louder? <br />
    Or should I find words that are already in your heart <br />
    So that when I whisper them, and let them hang in the air, <br />
    Each word’s twin softly vibrates in sympathy? <br />
    And if that is needed, how to learn those words? <br />
    I cannot unlock your heart, or everyone’s. <br />
    If I found some way to love you (or all) <br />
    That love would not likely be returned (by all).  </p>

    <p>So for now I shout, <br />
    And maybe one day I’ll work up the courage <br />
    To tear open my own heart, and in doing so <br />
    Learn the songs which are common to us all.  </p>
